# We Hate Scrum v0.0.1 [WIP ðŸš§]
---
## Concept
This cute little program attempts to eliminate the need of scrums by keeping track of commit messages, number of insertions/deletions against the author for every included work repository in the last day or in any date range [soon].

### Features planned:
- [x] Custom date range setter (1d, 7d, 14d, 1m, etc.)

- [ ] Counting unmerged PR changes into the summary

- [ ] ...

## Usage Steps
1. Clone this repo
1. Get an access token from GitHub & save it in a file `token.txt` in project root with repo read/write access from GitHub under Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
1. Create an `entrypoint.sh` file in project root (take reference from below `entrypoint.sh` template). This file is run while building Docker image & pre-loads your git repositories
1. Build Docker image by running: `docker build --build-arg gh_token="$(cat token.txt)" -t wehatescrum .`
1. Upload the built image to your preferred registry & run the Docker image `docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file ./.env wehatescrum`

*See `.env.example` file for more info on providing a .env file to `docker run` command*

### `entrypoint.sh` template
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ONLY PARTS with "<...>" present to be edited, it works, please don't touch it...

# List of repositories to clone
repositories=(
    "--branch <...your branch name...> https://$TOKEN@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME_1>"
    "--branch <...your branch name...> https://$TOKEN@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME_2>"
    <...>
)

# Use printf to convert the array into a newline-separated string and pipe it into xargs
printf "%s\n" "${repositories[@]}" | xargs -P 3 -I {} sh -c 'git clone --single-branch {}'
```
